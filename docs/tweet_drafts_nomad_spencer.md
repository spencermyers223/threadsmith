## Build in Public (Weekly Updates)

### Tweet 1 - Week Update
```
Week 4 building xthread:

✅ Shipped algorithm scoring for posts
✅ Content calendar with scheduling
✅ Voice training from your past tweets

❌ Spent 2 days debugging auth issues

Next: Demo videos and first marketing push

Building an AI content tool for tech Twitter. Updates every week.
```

### Tweet 2 - Milestone
```
Just hit a milestone with xthread:

The AI now scores your posts BEFORE you tweet them.

It checks:
• Hook strength
• Engagement triggers
• Optimal length
• Reply-bait potential

Stop guessing. Know if your tweet will perform before you hit send.
```

### Tweet 3 - Behind the Scenes
```
What building an AI content tool actually looks like:

- 6am coding sessions before work
- Explaining to friends that "no it's not ChatGPT"
- Rewriting the same prompt 47 times
- Watching competitors raise millions for worse products

Still the best decision I've made.
```

## Hot Takes

### Tweet 4 - Contrarian
```
Hot take: Most "AI writing tools" make your content worse.

They optimize for volume, not quality.
They sound robotic because they ARE robotic.
They don't know your voice.

I'm building xthread to fix this. AI that sounds like YOU, not a corporate blog.
```

### Tweet 5 - Industry Observation
```
The content tool space is broken:

- Generic tools charging $50/mo for GPT wrappers
- "Viral templates" that everyone uses (so nobody stands out)
- Zero understanding of specific niches

That's why I'm building for tech Twitter specifically. Depth > breadth.
```

### Tweet 6 - Prediction
```
Prediction: In 2 years, every serious creator will have an AI trained on their writing style.

Not generic AI. YOUR AI.

The creators who figure this out first will have an unfair advantage.

I'm building the tool to make this accessible to everyone.
```

## Engagement Hooks

### Tweet 7 - Question
```
Genuine question for tech Twitter creators:

What's harder - coming up with ideas or actually writing the post?

Building something to help with both. Want to know which pain point is worse.
```

### Tweet 8 - Poll Setup
```
How many tweets do you draft before posting one?

For me it's usually 3-4. Sometimes I'll write 10 variations of a hook before I'm happy.

Curious if I'm overthinking it or if this is normal.
```

### Tweet 9 - Relatable
```
The content creator cycle:

1. Have great idea in shower
2. Forget it by the time you're dry
3. Stare at blank screen
4. Write something mid
5. Post anyway
6. Get 12 likes
7. Repeat

Building a tool to break this cycle.
```

## Alpha/Insight Posts

### Tweet 10 - Tactical Advice
```
The #1 thing killing your tweet performance:

Weak hooks.

Your first line has 0.5 seconds to stop the scroll.

What works:
• Numbers ("7 tools that...")
• Contrarian ("Unpopular opinion...")
• Curiosity gap ("Here's what nobody tells you...")

What doesn't:
• Starting with "I" 
• Vague statements
• No tension
```

### Tweet 11 - Data Insight
```
Analyzed 500 viral tech Twitter posts. Here's what I found:

• 73% use a number in the first line
• Average length: 180 characters (not 280)
• Question tweets get 2x more replies
• "Thread" in a single tweet = -40% engagement

Building these insights into xthread's scoring algorithm.
```

### Tweet 12 - Process Share
```
My content workflow (as a solo founder with a day job):

Sunday: Brain dump 10 ideas
Monday-Friday: Write 1 post/day (15 min)
Saturday: Schedule next week

Total time: ~2 hours/week

The secret? I never start from a blank page. I use templates.
```

## Product Teasers

### Tweet 13 - Feature Highlight
```
Just added "Algorithm Score" to xthread.

Before you post, it shows:
📊 Predicted engagement level
🎯 Hook strength rating
⚡ Optimal posting time
💡 Suggestions to improve

Like Grammarly but for going viral.

Testing with early users now.
```

### Tweet 14 - Problem/Solution
```
The problem with AI content tools:

They don't know the difference between LinkedIn cringe and Twitter alpha.

xthread is trained specifically on what works in tech/crypto Twitter.

Different platforms. Different vibes. Different AI.
```

### Tweet 15 - Launch Teaser
```
Building in public update:

xthread is almost ready for early users.

What it does:
→ Generate posts in YOUR voice
→ Score content before posting
→ Schedule with optimal timing
→ Templates for tech Twitter

DM me "EARLY" if you want access before public launch.
```

## Bonus: Thread Opener

### Tweet 16 - Thread Start
```
I'm building an AI content tool while working a 9-5.

Here's everything I've learned in 4 weeks of building xthread:

(A thread for solo founders)

🧵
```

**Thread tweets:**
```
1/ The hardest part isn't coding. It's staying consistent.

I wake up at 6am to get 2 hours of building before work.

Some days I'm exhausted. I do it anyway.

Consistency > motivation.
```

```
2/ Your first version will be embarrassing.

xthread v1 was literally just a text box and a button.

But it worked. And I could test with real users.

Ship fast. Improve later.
```

```
3/ Talk to users before you build features.

I spent a week building something nobody asked for.

Now I DM potential users FIRST. Then build what they actually need.
```

```
4/ The best marketing is building in public.

Every tweet about xthread = free marketing
Every failure shared = connection with other builders
Every win celebrated = social proof

Your journey IS your content.
```

```
5/ You don't need to quit your job (yet).

I'm building xthread with ~15 hours/week.

It's slow. But it's sustainable.

The goal: Replace my salary, THEN quit.

Not the other way around.
```
