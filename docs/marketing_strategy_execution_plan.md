# xthread Marketing Strategy Execution Plan
*Created Jan 27, 2026 — Target: First paying customer by end of Feb 2026*

## The Core Problem
Spencer has ~146 followers and zero customers. The product is solid but invisible. We need to go from 0 to 1 customer in 34 days.

## Strategy: Build in Public + Video Demo + Targeted Outreach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1 — Jan 27-Feb 2)
**Goal:** Establish consistent posting rhythm and create demo content

**Daily Actions:**
- Post 2-3 times/day using xthread itself (eat our own dog food)
- Mix of: 1 build-in-public + 1 niche content (crypto/markets) + 1 product-related
- Reply to 10-15 accounts in our target audience daily (small crypto builders, CT creators)

**One-time Actions:**
- [ ] Record first screen recording (Script 1: "What is xthread?" - 60 sec)
- [ ] Post to Build in Public community on X
- [ ] Create xthread demo account with sample data for demos
- [ ] Sign up for ProductHunt (prep for later launch)

### Phase 2: Content Flywheel (Week 2-3 — Feb 3-16)
**Goal:** Build credibility and start getting noticed

**Daily Actions:**
- Continue 2-3 posts/day
- Engage with 15-20 accounts (be genuinely helpful, not spammy)
- Share one "behind the scenes" insight per day

**Weekly Actions:**
- Record 1 new demo video each week (different angle/script)
- Write 1 alpha thread or protocol breakdown using xthread (show product in action)
- Share growth metrics publicly (follower count, engagement rates, signups)

**Milestone targets:**
- 250+ followers by Feb 9
- 5+ people have tried the free tier by Feb 9
- 1 piece of content gets 500+ impressions

### Phase 3: Conversion Push (Week 4-5 — Feb 17-28)
**Goal:** Convert free users to paid

**Actions:**
- DM anyone who signed up for free tier with a personal message
- Offer lifetime deal ($99.99) as early adopter pricing with urgency
- Post case study: "I used xthread for 30 days — here's what happened"
- Share specific metrics: posts generated, time saved, engagement improvement

**Conversion tactics:**
- Personal onboarding calls for anyone interested
- "Building this for people like you" energy
- Limit free tier just enough to showcase value (they already have the generation limit)

## Channel Strategy

### Primary: X (@nomad_spencer)
- 2-3 posts/day, every day, no exceptions
- Use xthread to generate content (meta-proof the product works)
- Focus on crypto Twitter + indie builder audiences
- Reply strategy: find people complaining about X growth, offer value

### Secondary: Video (Screen Recordings → TikTok/Reels later)
- Start with X-native video (screen recordings posted as tweets)
- Graduate to short-form video on TikTok/Instagram once comfortable
- Scripts already written (3 ready for review)

### Tertiary: Communities
- Build in Public community on X
- Indie Hackers (post monthly updates)
- Crypto Discord communities (share value, mention tool naturally)

## Content Pillars (Rotating)

1. **Build in Public** (3-4x/week) — Journey updates, metrics, struggles, wins
2. **Crypto/Market Takes** (2-3x/week) — Shows expertise, attracts target audience
3. **Product Demos** (2x/week) — Screenshots, quick videos, feature highlights
4. **X Growth Tips** (1-2x/week) — Algorithm insights, positioning as authority
5. **Hot Takes** (1x/week) — Engagement drivers, shows personality

## Key Metrics to Track Weekly

| Metric | Week 1 Target | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 |
|--------|--------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Followers | 175 | 225 | 300 | 400 |
| Avg impressions/post | 50 | 100 | 200 | 300 |
| Free signups | 2 | 5 | 10 | 15 |
| Paid customers | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1+ |
| Posts/day | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 |
| Replies sent/day | 10 | 15 | 15 | 20 |

## Budget: $0

Everything here is free:
- xthread is our own product
- X posting is free (Spencer has Premium ✅)
- Screen recordings via QuickTime (free)
- No paid ads until we have product-market fit

---

## Risk Factors

1. **Low initial reach** — 146 followers means low impressions. Mitigation: focus on replies and engagement to grow organically.
2. **Content fatigue** — 2-3 posts/day is a lot. Mitigation: xthread makes this manageable (that's literally the value prop).
3. **No social proof** — Zero customers. Mitigation: build-in-public transparency IS the social proof.
4. **Crypto market dependency** — If market goes sideways, crypto content gets less engagement. Mitigation: diversify into builder/AI content.

## Decision Points for Spencer

1. **Pricing:** Keep $9.99/mo + $99.99 lifetime, or adjust? (I'd keep it — low barrier to entry)
2. **Free tier limits:** Current generation limits feel right. Too generous = no reason to pay. Too strict = can't showcase value.
3. **ProductHunt timing:** Launch when we have at least 5-10 users for social proof (target mid-Feb?)
4. **TikTok/Instagram accounts:** Create now or wait? (I'd wait until we have 2-3 good screen recordings)

*Status: READY FOR REVIEW*
*This plan assumes Spencer can post daily. If schedule is tighter, we scale back to 1-2 posts/day.*
