# xthread Content Playbook — Bulletproof Marketing Plan

*Compiled from algorithm research, CT patterns analysis, and production learnings*

---

## Part 1: Content Pillars (What We Post)

### Pillar 1: Build in Public (40% of content)
**Why:** Highest relatability, builds trust, attracts other builders
**Formats:**
- Daily/weekly progress updates ("Week X building xthread...")
- Honest metrics (even when they're low)
- Lessons learned / mistakes made
- Behind-the-scenes (AI agent, Mac Mini setup, decision-making)
- Milestone celebrations

**Hook patterns that work:**
- "Honest moment: [vulnerable truth]"
- "Week X building [product]:" followed by bullet wins
- "Things we got wrong this week:"
- "I got tired of [pain point]. So I built something."

### Pillar 2: Crypto Niche Knowledge (30% of content)
**Why:** Establishes credibility, attracts target audience (CT creators)
**Formats:**
- Market takes (quick price/trend analysis)
- Hot takes (contrarian opinions that spark debate)
- On-chain insights (data-driven observations)
- Protocol breakdowns (educational)
- Alpha threads (deep research)

**Hook patterns that work:**
- "[Protocol] just hit [metric]. Here's why that matters."
- "Hot take: [thing everyone assumes] is wrong."
- "Everyone is watching [X] but nobody noticed [Y]."
- Data-first: lead with the number, then explain

### Pillar 3: Product Showcases (30% of content)
**Why:** Direct conversion, shows the tool in action
**Formats:**
- Screen recordings (our 10 demo videos)
- Feature spotlights
- Before/after (manual posting vs xthread)
- Algorithm education (why xthread's approach works)
- User testimonials (once we have users)

**Hook patterns that work:**
- "The X algorithm weighs [metric] at [weight]x. So why is everyone..."
- "I use xthread to [action]. Here's why:"
- "6 post types, each built differently because..."
- Problem → solution framing

## Part 2: Platform-Specific Strategy

### X/Twitter (Primary)
- **Frequency:** 2-3 posts/day
- **Best times:** 8am, 12pm, 5pm CST (Tue-Thu highest engagement)
- **Thread vs tweet:** Single tweets for hot takes and quick observations. Threads for deep dives and educational content.
- **Engagement:** Reply to 10-15 accounts daily in the build-in-public and crypto niches
- **Key metric:** Reply rate (75x algorithm weight) > likes (0.5x)

### X Algorithm Cheat Sheet
| Signal | Weight | What it means |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Replies | 75x | Most valuable — end every post with a question |
| Retweets | 5x | Shareable content (data, lists, frameworks) |
| Likes | 0.5x | Good but least valuable |
| Bookmarks | 2x | Indicates "save for later" value |
| Time spent | 10x | Longer dwell = more distribution |

### Short-Form Video (TikTok/Reels — Future)
- **Frequency:** 1-2/day when we start
- **Length:** 15-30 seconds (hook in first 2s)
- **Style:** Screen recordings with text overlays + lo-fi/trap beats
- **No face required** — product demos, before/after, quick tips
- **CTA:** "Link in bio" or "try xthread free"

## Part 3: Content Production Pipeline

### For Tweets
1. Use xthread's research vault → generate content through the product
2. Review output, pick best variation
3. Edit for voice consistency (no corporate AI slop)
4. Schedule on xthread calendar
5. Post at optimal time
6. Engage with replies for 30 min after posting

### For Screen Recording Videos
**Process (documented from our Jan 27-28 production run):**
1. Write script with timestamps and text overlays (store in Second Brain)
2. Set xthread to LIGHT MODE
3. Pre-populate the app with realistic data (research files, drafts, calendar entries)
4. Use browser automation to capture screenshots at each step
5. Scale to 1920x1080, add text overlays with Pillow
6. Assemble with ffmpeg (crossfade transitions, 30fps)
7. Add music track (lo-fi or trap beat — separate from video)
8. QC: check every frame, verify text readability, ensure fluid feel

**Technical learnings:**
- ffmpeg drawtext requires freetype — use Pillow for text overlays instead
- Browser viewport ~1200px, upscale to 1080p
- 20-40 screenshots per 30s video for smooth transitions
- Each scene: 3-5 seconds depending on complexity
- Crossfade transitions feel more professional than hard cuts
- Dark semi-transparent bar at bottom for text overlays

### For Long-Form Video (Future)
- Spencer on camera or voiceover
- Screen recording + face cam overlay
- Script structure: Hook (5s) → Problem (10s) → Solution (15s) → Demo (30-60s) → CTA (10s)

## Part 4: Voice & Style Guide

### Brand Voice: "Builder-First CT Native"
- **Direct** — No fluff, no corporate speak
- **Data-driven** — Lead with numbers when possible
- **Honest** — Admit when things are hard, metrics are low, mistakes were made
- **Opinionated** — Take positions, don't hedge everything
- **Conversational** — Like texting a smart friend, not writing a press release

### Words We Use
✅ "shipped", "built", "tested", "broke", "fixed"
✅ "CT", "alpha", "degen", "LFG"
✅ Specific numbers, metrics, data points
✅ Questions that invite replies

### Words We Avoid
❌ "Excited to announce", "thrilled to share"
❌ "Leverage", "utilize", "innovative"
❌ Generic phrases: "game-changer", "next-level"
❌ Excessive emojis (1-2 max per post)
❌ "We're building the future of..." (overused)

### Company Voice (for @xthreadapp)
- Uses "we" not "I"
- More product-focused, less personal
- Still casual and CT-native
- Links to features, not just claims

### Spencer's Voice (for @nomad_spencer)
- Uses both "I" and "we"
- More personal, build-in-public focused
- Comfortable being vulnerable about the journey
- Crypto niche expertise + builder narrative

- Join CT conversations (reply to bigger accounts with insight, not just "great post!")
- Share real metrics (even if small)
- DM 5 potential users per week

### Phase 2: Momentum (500 → 2,000 followers)
- Increase to 3x/day
- Start video content (screen recordings)
- Guest threads / collaboration with other builders
- "Building in public" case study post (30-day recap)
- Feature user testimonials

### Phase 3: Authority (2,000+ followers)
- Establish as the CT content tool
- Regular deep-dive threads on algorithm/content strategy
- Community building (Discord, Telegram)
- Potential partnerships with CT accounts

### Key Metrics to Track
- Follower growth rate (weekly)
- Average impressions per post
- Reply rate per post
- Profile visits → website clicks
- Free signups → paid conversion
- Best performing post types/times

## Part 7: Inspiration & References

### Accounts to Study (Build in Public)
- Builders who share metrics openly
- Solo founders documenting the journey
- Accounts that grew from 0 to 10k+ through consistent posting

### Content Formats That Go Viral on CT
1. **"Most people" opener** — contrarian setup → insight payoff
2. **Number-first** — "Sui hit $2.2B TVL" → explanation
3. **List format** — "6 things I learned building X:" (easy to scan)
4. **Comparison** — "ChatGPT vs xthread" (visual or text)
5. **Confession/vulnerability** — "Honest moment:" (builds trust)
6. **Thread with receipts** — claims backed by screenshots/data

### Music for Videos
- Lo-fi hip hop for calm/educational content
- Trap beats for punchy/hype content
- Electronic for fast-paced montage/demo
- No vocals — instrumental only
- Source: royalty-free libraries (Epidemic Sound, Artlist, or free alternatives)
