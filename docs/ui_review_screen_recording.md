# UI Review for Screen Recording Readiness
*Reviewed Jan 27, 2026*

## Overall Verdict: READY (with minor polish suggestions)

The app looks clean, professional, and screen-recording-ready. Dark mode is consistent, spacing is good, and the UI tells a clear story. A few tweaks would elevate the recording quality.

## Page-by-Page Review

### Creator Hub (Main Page) ✅
**Looks great.** Clean layout, clear post type cards, good visual hierarchy.
- The 6 post type cards are well-designed with icons and descriptions
- Length selector (Punchy/Standard/Developed/Thread) is clean
- File sidebar is useful but might confuse first-time viewers in a demo

**Minor suggestions:**
- The "Pro — Unlimited generations" banner is good social proof for the video
- Consider having pre-filled content in the topic box during recording (looks more natural)

### Workspace ✅
**Clean and functional.** Tweet/Thread/Article tabs are clear.
- Preview panel with mock tweet is excellent for demos
- Character counter (0/280) is a nice touch
- Drafts sidebar is clean

**Minor suggestions:**
- The "Empty draft - 8 days ago" looks a bit bare. Create a real draft before recording.
- "Your Name @yourhandle" placeholder should ideally show real data for the recording

### Calendar ✅
**Strong visual.** Calendar view with color-coded posts looks professional.
- The existing posts (Token 2022, MetaDAO, etc.) add credibility
- Filter options (Post type, Filter by tag) show depth
- Calendar/List toggle is clean

**Minor suggestions:**
- Add a few more posts to different days so the calendar looks fuller during recording
- The "Generate threads describi..." text is truncated — might want a shorter title

### Settings ✅
**Professional.** Clean sections, good organization.
- Content Niche with primary/secondary interests looks thoughtful
- Dark mode toggle is working properly
- Notification settings show maturity

**No changes needed for recording.**

## Issues Found

### No Critical Issues
- ✅ Dark mode is consistent across all pages
- ✅ No broken layouts or visual bugs
- ✅ Navigation is smooth between pages
- ✅ Responsive elements work properly
- ✅ Animations are smooth

### Minor Polish (Pre-Recording)
1. **Workspace placeholder** — Create a real draft with content before recording
2. **Calendar density** — Add 3-4 more scheduled posts to fill out the calendar
3. **Files sidebar** — Consider collapsing it during Creator Hub recording (cleaner focus)

---

## Screen Recording Recommendations

### Recording Setup
- **Resolution:** 1920x1080 or 2560x1440 (MacBook native)
- **Browser:** Chrome, hide bookmarks bar, clean tab
- **Zoom:** 100% (don't zoom in, the UI is designed for full view)
- **Mouse:** Smooth, deliberate movements (not rushed)

### Script Flow (see separate doc for full scripts)
1. Start on Creator Hub — shows the core product
2. Enter topic, select post type, generate — the "wow" moment
3. Show Workspace for editing
4. Show Calendar for scheduling
5. Settings briefly to show personalization

*Status: REVIEW COMPLETE — App is screen-recording ready with minor prep*

**[Show generated results]**

"See? It doesn't invent fake metrics. It takes what I actually shipped and frames it in a way that's honest, specific, and invites feedback."

**[Edit one result in Workspace]**
