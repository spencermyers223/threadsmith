## Script 1: "What is xthread?" (30s voiceover)

**Screen actions (record at normal speed, play at 2-3x):**

**Voiceover (30s):**
"Most people spend an hour writing one tweet. With xthread, you type your idea, pick a post type, and get three algorithm-optimized variations in seconds. Edit it, schedule it, done. The AI is built specifically for crypto Twitter — it knows what drives replies, not just likes. Try it free at xthread.io."

## Script 2: "6 Post Types" (30s voiceover)

**Screen actions (record at normal speed, play at 2-3x):**
1. Creator Hub → hover over each of the 6 post type cards
2. Select "Alpha Thread" → type "IKA protocol — sub-second cross-chain signing"

4. Switch to "Hot Take" → type "Most L2s are just expensive databases"
5. Generate → show single tweet results
6. Quick flash of Workspace + Calendar

**Voiceover (30s):**
"xthread has 6 post types built for crypto Twitter. Alpha threads for research. Market takes for quick opinions. Hot takes for debate. On-chain insights for data. Protocol breakdowns for education. Build in public for your journey. Each one generates differently — threads, single tweets, the right format for the content. All optimized for the X algorithm."

## Script 3: "Build in Public" (30s voiceover)

**Screen actions (record at normal speed, play at 2-3x):**
1. Creator Hub → select "Build in Public"
2. Type "Just shipped 6 AI post types for crypto Twitter"
3. Generate → show results
4. Highlight a result that has a genuine question at the end
5. Save to Workspace → make a quick edit
6. Schedule to Calendar → show it on the calendar grid

**Voiceover (30s):**
"I built xthread and I use it every day. The build-in-public post type takes your real updates and turns them into posts that feel authentic — no fake metrics, no hype. Every post ends with a question because one reply is worth more than 150 likes on X. If you're building something, stop overthinking your posts. Let xthread handle it."

## Recording Tips
- **Pre-fill the Creator Hub** with a good topic so you're not typing live (or type something short)
- **Have drafts and calendar posts** already populated so the workspace/calendar look active
- **Clean browser:** hide bookmarks bar, close other tabs, use a clean Chrome window
- **Resolution:** 1920x1080 minimum
- **Editing:** Use CapCut, Descript, or iMovie for speed ramp + voiceover overlay

## Suggested Recording Order
1. **Script 1** — simplest, best intro video
2. **Script 3** — build-in-public angle resonates with CT
3. **Script 2** — most feature-heavy, save for when people already know what xthread is
