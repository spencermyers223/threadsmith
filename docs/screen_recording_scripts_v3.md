## Recording Tips
- **Light Mode:** Always record in light mode — pops better on social media
- **Pre-fill the Creator Hub** with a good topic so you're not typing live (or type something short)
- **Have drafts and calendar posts** already populated so the workspace/calendar look active
- **Clean browser:** hide bookmarks bar, close other tabs, use a clean Chrome window
- **Resolution:** 1920x1080 minimum
- **Screen Studio:** Use auto-zoom feature for professional look
- **Topics to use:** Mix of AI, general tech, building — avoid crypto-only

## Suggested Recording Order
1. **Script 1** — simplest, best intro video
2. **Script 5** — algorithm angle is a strong differentiator  
3. **Script 2** — feature overview once they know the product
4. **Script 3** — build-in-public resonates with founders/builders
5. **Script 6** — voice training is a premium feature
6. **Script 4** — niche flexibility shows breadth
