# Tweet Drafts — Batch 1 (Building in Public)
*For Spencer to review. Written in his voice based on voice profile analysis.*

---

## Draft 1 — The AI CTO reveal
> Built an AI agent that works as my CTO overnight while I sleep
> 
> It reviews code, fixes bugs, populates my task tracker, and sends me a morning brief at 6am
> 
> I'm a one-person team building xthread.io but I don't feel like one anymore

**Notes:** Authentic build-in-public moment. Shows the Jarvis setup without being too technical. Invites curiosity.

---

## Draft 2 — The honest struggle
> Hardest part of building a product isn't the code
> 
> It's posting about it when nobody's watching yet
> 
> 146 followers. Zero customers. But the product is getting better every single day. That's the only metric that matters right now.

**Notes:** Vulnerable, relatable for other small builders. The specific follower count makes it real.

---

## Draft 3 — Crypto Twitter pain point
> The irony of crypto Twitter:
> 
> • Everyone says "just post consistently"
> • Nobody tells you what to post
> • You spend 2 hours writing one tweet
> • It gets 12 views
> • Influencers copy-paste the same alpha thread template and get 50K
> 
> That's exactly why I'm building xthread

**Notes:** Leads with relatable pain, ends with product as natural solution. Not salesy.

---

## Draft 4 — Technical build update
> xthread now has 6 specialized AI post types:
> 
> • Alpha Thread — share research with structure
> • Market Take — your analysis, optimized for engagement
> • Hot Take — contrarian opinions that spark replies
> • On-Chain Insight — data-driven observations
> • Protocol Breakdown — educational deep dives
> • Build in Public — document your journey
> 
> Each one is tuned for how crypto Twitter actually works

**Notes:** Product feature showcase but framed as solving the "what to post" problem. Educational.

---

## Draft 5 — Late night builder energy
> It's 11pm and I just spent the last 3 hours improving the AI prompts behind xthread
> 
> The difference between good AI output and great AI output is obsessive prompt engineering
> 
> Nobody sees this work but it's the difference between a tool people try once and one they come back to

**Notes:** Shows dedication and craftsmanship. Builds trust that the product is quality.
