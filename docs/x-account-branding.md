# xthread — X/Twitter Account Branding Guide

---

## 1. Profile Photo Concepts

Three options designed for clarity at 48px circular crop:

### Option A: "The Gold X"
- A bold, slightly rounded **"x"** letterform centered on a **dark charcoal (#1A1A1A)** circle
- The "x" is rendered in the brand gold **#C9B896** with a subtle 1px lighter stroke (#D4C9A8) for definition
- Clean, no extra elements — just the mark
- **Why it works:** Dead simple, reads instantly at any size, the gold-on-dark pops in feeds

### Option B: "Thread Needle"
- Same dark charcoal circle background
- A stylized **"x"** where the bottom-right leg extends into a subtle **thread/needle trail** — a single curved line tapering off
- Gold #C9B896 for the x, slightly lighter gold for the thread tail
- **Why it works:** Connects "x" and "thread" visually without being busy

### Option C: "Stacked Block"
- A **solid gold (#C9B896) rounded square** (like an app icon shape) with a bold **white or dark "xt"** monogram inside
- The "x" is larger, the "t" smaller and tucked to the right — reads as a ligature
- **Why it works:** Stands out against X's dark UI, the rounded square feels app-native

**Recommendation:** Option A. Simplest, most versatile, strongest at tiny sizes.

**Canva instructions:** Create 400×400px circle, fill #1A1A1A, add text "x" in a geometric sans-serif (Inter Bold or Montserrat Bold), color #C9B896, center it. Export as PNG.

## 4. Header Image Concept

**Layout (1500×500px):**
- **Left side (60%):** Tagline text on a clean white/light background (#FAFAFA)
  - Primary text: **"Research → Content"** in bold dark type (#1A1A1A)
  - Subtitle: **"AI-powered posts for Crypto Twitter"** in lighter weight, smaller
  - "xthread.io" in brand gold (#C9B896) below
- **Right side (40%):** A light-mode screenshot of the xthread editor UI, slightly angled (5° tilt), with a soft drop shadow — cropped to show the input and output panels
- Subtle gold accent line or gradient strip along the bottom edge

**Style notes:**
- Keep it minimal — lots of whitespace
- Use the same font family as the app (Inter or similar clean sans-serif)
- Light mode screenshot only — pops on the dark X header area
- No busy patterns or crypto clichés (no rockets, no charts)
