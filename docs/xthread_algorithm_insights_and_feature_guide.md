# xthread Algorithm Insights & Feature Guide

This document serves as the educational foundation for xthread's website. It explains how the X algorithm works and how xthread's features are designed to optimize for it.

# The X Algorithm, Decoded.

**xthread doesn't just help you write posts. We engineer them for the algorithm.**

We've analyzed X's open-source recommendation code, studied millions of high-performing posts, and distilled it all into an AI that writes content optimized for how X actually works—not how most people think it works.

Here's what we've learned, and how xthread puts it to work for you.

---

## The Engagement Hierarchy

### Not all engagement is equal. Not even close.

Most people optimize for likes. That's a mistake. X's algorithm weights different actions dramatically differently:

| Action | Algorithmic Weight | Equivalent in Likes |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Reply where author responds | 75x | 150 likes |
| Reply | 13.5x | 27 likes |
| Profile click → engagement | 12x | 24 likes |
| Bookmark | ~5x | 10 likes |
| Retweet | 1-20x | 2-40 likes |
| **Like** | **0.5x** | **1 like** |

**The takeaway:** One thoughtful reply that sparks a conversation is worth more than 100 likes. xthread generates content designed to start conversations, not collect passive approval.

## The Golden Hour

### Your first 60 minutes determine everything.

X's algorithm doesn't treat all engagement equally over time. The speed of your early engagement is the primary signal for whether your post gets shown to more people—or dies quietly.

**How it works:**
- Posts are tested on a small portion of your audience first
- If engagement velocity is high in the first 30-60 minutes, X progressively shows it to more people
- If engagement is slow, the post gets deprioritized permanently
- Posts have a half-life of 6 hours—after that, reach drops 50%

**What this means for you:**
- Post when your audience is active
- Front-load your best content in the hook
- Make it easy to engage quickly (questions, polls, hot takes)
- When you get replies, respond fast—author replies carry 75x weight

---

## The Format Hierarchy

### What you post matters as much as how you write it.

X wants users to stay on the platform. Content formats are rewarded accordingly:

| Format | Reach Multiplier |
|--------|-----------------|
| Native video (under 2:20) | ~10x baseline |
| Images / GIFs / Carousels | 2x baseline |
| Polls | 1.5x baseline |
| Text-only | 1x baseline |
| External links | 0.5x baseline (50% penalty) |

**Threads are special:** They generate 40-60% more total impressions than equivalent single posts. The algorithm interprets users clicking through a thread as a quality signal.

**The link problem:** External links get suppressed because X wants to keep users on-platform. The workaround: post your main content without the link, then add the link in your first reply.

---

## The Premium Reality

### X has become a two-tier system.

We're not here to sell you X Premium—but you should understand the playing field.

**What the code reveals:**
- Premium subscribers get a **4x boost** for content shown to followers
- Premium subscribers get a **2x boost** for content shown to non-followers
- Studies show Premium accounts get approximately **10x more reach** per post

**What this means:**
- If you're serious about growth, Premium is nearly essential
- If you're not on Premium, your content needs to work harder—which is exactly what xthread helps with
- Link penalties are reduced for Premium accounts

---

## What Kills Your Reach

### The algorithm penalizes harder than it rewards.

Negative signals carry catastrophic weight. A single report can undo hundreds of likes.

| Negative Signal | Penalty |
|-----------------|---------|
| Report | -369 (requires 738 likes to offset) |
| Block / Mute / "Show less" | -74 (requires 148 likes to offset) |
| "Not Interested" click | 80% reach reduction for 140 days |
| Misspellings / unknown words | 95% reach reduction |
| Excessive hashtags (3+) | ~40% reach reduction |
| External links | ~50% reach reduction |
| All caps / excessive punctuation | Spam signal, variable penalty |

**xthread protects you:** Our AI is trained to avoid patterns that trigger penalties—no misspellings, no hashtag stuffing, no spam signals.

## The Myths We've Debunked

### What most "experts" get wrong.

| Myth | Reality |
|------|---------|
| "More followers = more reach" | Engagement rate matters far more than follower count |
| "Use trending hashtags" | Only niche-relevant hashtags help. 1-2 max. |
| "Post as often as possible" | 2-3 quality posts/day is optimal. More can trigger spam detection. |
| "Likes are the goal" | Replies are worth 27x more. Conversations > applause. |
| "Long posts perform better" | Posts under 100 characters get 17% more engagement |
| "The algorithm is random" | It's a 48-million-parameter neural network with clear, documented weights |

# How xthread Works For You

Every feature in xthread is designed around these algorithmic realities. Here's how to use each one effectively.

---

## Post Types

### Choose the right format for your content.

xthread offers specialized post types, each optimized for different goals. The AI adjusts its writing style, structure, and engagement hooks based on your selection.

### Alpha Thread
**What it's for:** Sharing non-obvious insights, research findings, or analysis that most people haven't seen.

**How it's optimized:**
- Opens with a bold hook that creates curiosity
- Structures insights across 5-7 tweets for optimal thread length
- Builds to a conclusion that invites discussion
- Ends with a question or implication to drive replies

**When to use it:** When you have genuine insight to share—something you've researched, discovered, or figured out that others would find valuable.

**Best practices:**
- Lead with the "so what" before the "what"
- One key insight per tweet
- Include data or evidence where possible
- Save hashtags for the final tweet

---

### Market Take
**What it's for:** Quick opinions on price action, macro events, or market sentiment.

**How it's optimized:**
- Concise format (under 100 characters when possible)
- Strong opinion upfront—no hedging
- Structured to invite agreement or disagreement (both drive replies)

**When to use it:** When something is happening in the market and you have a take. Speed matters—post while the topic is hot.

**Best practices:**
- Don't hedge with "I think maybe possibly"
- State your position clearly
- Be willing to be wrong publicly (this builds credibility over time)
- Post within hours of the event, not days

---

### Protocol Breakdown
**What it's for:** Educational deep dives explaining how something works.

**How it's optimized:**
- Thread format for depth
- Progressive complexity (simple → detailed)
- Visual break points for readability
- Conclusion focuses on "why this matters"

**When to use it:** When you want to establish expertise by teaching others about a protocol, mechanism, or concept.

**Best practices:**
- Start with why anyone should care
- Use analogies for complex concepts
- One concept per tweet
- End with implications or what to watch

---

### On-Chain Insight
**What it's for:** Data-driven observations from blockchain analytics.

**How it's optimized:**
- Leads with the insight, not the data
- Structures the "what → so what → now what" flow
- Designed to pair with chart/screenshot attachments

**When to use it:** When you've spotted something interesting in on-chain data that has implications others should know about.

**Best practices:**
- Don't just show data—interpret it
- Lead with what the data *means*
- Include the chart/screenshot as visual proof
- Suggest what to watch next

---

### CT Hot Take
**What it's for:** Contrarian or spicy opinions designed for engagement.

**How it's optimized:**
- Bold, declarative statements
- Structured to invite disagreement (replies are 27x more valuable)
- Short format for maximum shareability

**When to use it:** When you have a genuine contrarian view and want to spark discussion. Not for rage-bait—for real opinions others might push back on.

**Best practices:**
- Actually believe what you're saying
- Be prepared to defend your position in replies
- Don't be contrarian just for engagement—it burns credibility
- Respond to disagreement thoughtfully (author replies = 75x boost)

---

### Build in Public
**What it's for:** Updates on your projects, learnings, and journey.

**How it's optimized:**
- Personal, authentic tone
- Focuses on specific progress and honest struggles
- Structured to invite community support and advice

**When to use it:** When sharing updates about Nomad Research, xthread, or any project you're building. Vulnerability and specificity outperform polished announcements.

**Best practices:**
- Include specific numbers when possible
- Share struggles, not just wins
- Ask for input or feedback (drives replies)
- Be consistent—build-in-public works through accumulation

---

## Post Editing Tools

### Refine your content after generation.

After xthread generates a post, you can refine it with one-click editing tools. Each tool applies a specific optimization.

### Add Hook
**What it does:** Rewrites the opening line to stop the scroll.

**When to use it:** When your post starts with context instead of impact. The hook should make someone stop scrolling and want to read more.

**How it's optimized:** Uses proven hook patterns—bold claims, curiosity gaps, specific numbers, or direct audience targeting.

---

### Humanize
**What it does:** Adjusts the language to sound less AI-generated.

**When to use it:** When the post feels too polished, too generic, or uses phrasing you'd never actually say.

**How it's optimized:** Adds natural speech patterns, slight imperfections, personality, and your voice characteristics (learned from your profile and past content).

---

### Add Question
**What it does:** Adds a question at the end to drive replies.

**When to use it:** When your post is informational but doesn't invite response. Remember: one reply = 27 likes in algorithmic value.

**How it's optimized:** Adds questions that are easy to answer and relevant to your audience. Avoids generic "what do you think?" in favor of specific, engaging questions.

---

### Shorten
**What it does:** Cuts the post down while preserving the core message.

**When to use it:** When your post exceeds 100 characters (the engagement sweet spot) or feels like it's rambling.

**How it's optimized:** Removes filler words, redundant phrases, and unnecessary context. Keeps the insight, cuts the fluff.

---

### Make Spicier
**What it does:** Adds more opinion, edge, or personality.

**When to use it:** When your post is too safe or bland. Opinion drives engagement—people share and reply to takes they agree or disagree with.

**How it's optimized:** Sharpens the opinion, removes hedging language, and adds confidence. Stays within bounds that won't trigger reports.

---

### Expand to Thread
**What it does:** Transforms a single post into a multi-tweet thread.

**When to use it:** When your idea deserves more depth. Threads get 40-60% more impressions than single posts.

**How it's optimized:** Structures the thread with a magnetic hook (tweet 1), one insight per tweet (tweets 2-6), and a CTA with hashtags (final tweet). Keeps each tweet under 250 characters for readability.

---

## Scheduling

### Post when your audience is active.

The golden hour matters. Posting when your followers are online maximizes early engagement velocity, which determines whether your post gets amplified or buried.

**General best practices:**
- Weekday mornings (Tuesday-Thursday, 8AM-2PM) consistently outperform
- Weekends typically see lower engagement
- Late night posts miss the golden hour window
- Consistency matters more than perfection—same time daily builds audience habits

**With X API connected:**
xthread analyzes when your specific followers are most active and suggests optimal posting windows personalized to your audience. This removes the guesswork.

**Scheduling tips:**
- Space posts 2-3 hours apart minimum
- Don't schedule more than 3 posts per day (quality > quantity)
- Leave room to post reactively when news breaks

---

## Research Files

### Turn your research into content.

xthread isn't just a post generator—it's a research-to-content pipeline. The file system lets you store notes, upload documents, and generate posts from your actual research.

**How to use it:**
1. **Create files** for ongoing research topics, market notes, or content ideas
2. **Upload documents** (PDFs, screenshots, reports) for reference
3. **Generate posts** by selecting a file and letting the AI pull insights from your research
4. **Organize with folders and tags** to keep your content library manageable

**Why this matters:**
- Your posts will have substance because they're based on real research
- You maintain your voice because the AI works from *your* notes
- You never run out of content ideas—your research library becomes your content backlog

**Best practices:**
- Capture ideas immediately—create a "scratchpad" file for quick notes
- Tag files by topic for easy retrieval
- When you spot something interesting on-chain or in the market, note it before you forget
- Use the AI to transform rough notes into polished posts

---

## Voice Learning

### Sound like yourself, not like AI.

xthread learns your writing style over time. The more you use it, the better it matches your voice.

**How it works:**
- During onboarding, you can paste examples of your best tweets
- The AI extracts patterns: vocabulary, sentence rhythm, opinion style, formatting habits
- Every post generated blends proven structures with your personal voice
- As you edit outputs, the system learns your preferences

**What gets learned:**
- Words and phrases you use frequently
- How you structure arguments
- Your level of formality
- Punctuation and formatting habits
- Whether you use emojis, how often, which ones
- Your typical post length

**Best practices:**
- Provide 5-10 examples of posts you're proud of during setup
- Edit generated posts when they don't sound like you—the system learns
- Update your voice profile periodically as your style evolves

---

## Tags & Folders

### Organize your content library.

As you create more files and drafts, organization becomes essential. Tags and folders help you find what you need and see patterns in your content.

**Folders:** Use for broad categories
- By project (Nomad Research, Personal Brand, etc.)
- By content type (Market Takes, Research, Threads)
- By status (Ideas, Drafts, Published)

**Tags:** Use for cross-cutting themes
- Topics (#defi, #bitcoin, #onchain)
- Content characteristics (#spicy, #educational, #data)
- Performance tracking (#banger, #underperformed)

**Best practices:**
- Keep folder structure simple—3-5 folders max
- Use tags liberally—they're searchable
- Review your tags periodically to see what content you're creating most

---

## Profile Customization

### Tell xthread who you are.

Your profile settings shape how the AI writes for you. The more context you provide, the better your outputs.

**What to include:**

**Your niche/expertise:** What topics do you cover? What's your angle?

**Your audience:** Who are you writing for? Their knowledge level matters.

**Accounts you admire:** Whose style do you want to emulate? We'll study their patterns.

**Your goals:** Building authority? Growing followers? Driving traffic? Different goals = different optimization.

**X Premium status:** This affects how we handle links and long-form content.

**Best practices:**
- Be specific about your niche—"crypto" is too broad, "DeFi yield strategies for institutions" is useful
- Update your profile as your focus evolves
- Add accounts you admire even if they're not in your exact niche—style transcends topic
