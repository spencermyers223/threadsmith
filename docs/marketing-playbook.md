# xthread Marketing Playbook

## Goal: First Paying Customer

This playbook is for getting xthread from 0 to first paying customers, then scaling to 100+.

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Launch (Now)

### 1. Build in Public on X
**Why:** Most successful micro-SaaS founders got their first customers through Twitter/X. Your audience is already there.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Tweet 2-3x daily from @nomad_spencer
- [ ] Document the building journey (wins, struggles, lessons)
- [ ] Share screenshots/videos of new features (LIGHT MODE)
- [ ] Engage with other builders (reply to 10+ tweets daily)

**Content Mix:**
- 40% Building updates ("Just shipped X feature...")
- 30% Lessons learned ("What I learned building...")
- 20% Hot takes on content creation/X growth
- 10% Personal/relatable content

### 2. Product Demo Video
**Why:** People need to SEE the product work. A 60-90 second demo converts better than 1000 words.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Record walkthrough: sign up → generate → post
- [ ] Highlight: voice training, algorithm score, one-click posting
- [ ] Add to landing page hero section
- [ ] Cut into short clips for X/TikTok

### 3. Landing Page Optimization
**Current:** ✅ Done - universal positioning, clear value prop

**Still Needed:**
- [ ] Social proof (testimonials when we get them)
- [ ] Product screenshots/video
- [ ] FAQ section addressing objections

## Phase 2: Launch Push

### 1. Product Hunt Launch
**When:** After we have a polished demo video and a few beta users

**Prep:**
- [ ] Build a list of supporters to upvote
- [ ] Prepare launch assets (logo, screenshots, description)
- [ ] Schedule for Tuesday-Thursday (best PH days)
- [ ] Have a "first 50 customers" deal ready

### 2. Community Seeding
**Where to post:**
- Indie Hackers (show, post updates)
- r/SaaS
- r/EntrepreneurRideAlong
- r/SideProject

**How:**
